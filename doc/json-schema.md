Last week I started to think about the pattern of the admin requests and how each can be validated prior to being sent to CJDNS' admin interface. A module I worked with in the past called [resourceful](https://github.com/flatiron/resourceful) which is related to [revalidator](https://github.com/flatiron/revalidator) implement [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).

It is possible that the existing implementation of the admin functions could be enhanced with validation messages and dropped into a JSON Schema validator.

This is something I would like to explore. If you are reading and have any thoughts on this do let me know. I could use some more eyes on this.
